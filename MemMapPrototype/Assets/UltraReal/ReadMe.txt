Getting Started!

1.	 Import the Moba Movement package into a fresh Unity scene.

2.	 Create a plane by using GameObject/3D Object/Plane from the menu.

3.	In the plane’s inspector, set the Static checkmark.

4.	In the Plane inspector, add a layer to the Layer tab and call it 
	“CameraPick”.  Set the plane to this layer.  This layer may already 
	exist if you used the project settings from the Asset Store package.

5.	Drag the Default Moba Player prefab from the Ultra Real/Moba Movement/Prefabs 
	folder into the scene on top of the plane.

6.	Drag the MobaCameraRig prefab from the Ultra Real/Moba Movement/Prefabs 
	folder into the scene on top of the plane.

7.	Delete or disable any existing cameras in the scene.

8.	Drag the Moba Movement Manager from the Ultra Real/Moba Movement/Prefabs 
	folder into the scene hierarchy.
9.	In the main menu, select Window/Navigation to bring up Unity’s navigation options.

10.	Save your scene. (This is needed for the Navigation system)

11.	Under the Navigation tab, press bake.  You should see a blue shape fill the plane.

12.	Press Play!
